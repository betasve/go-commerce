## Project Scope

### Milestone 1: Project Setup and Core Architecture

Objective: Set up the foundational architecture for the microservice environment, including initial project structure and essential tools.

    Tasks:
        Define the microservices architecture (e.g., product, order, user, inventory).
        Set up version control with Git and initialize a GitHub repository.
        > Create Docker configuration for each service to support isolated environments.
        Set up a message queue system (e.g., Kafka) to manage inter-service communication.
        Define API contracts using OpenAPI (Swagger) or gRPC for service communication.
        Implement basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

### Milestone 2: User and Authentication Service

Objective: Develop a service that manages user registration, authentication, and authorization.

    Tasks:
        Design the user database schema (e.g., PostgreSQL).
        Implement user registration, login, and password management features.
        Add JWT-based authentication for secure API access.
        Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types (e.g., admin, customer).
        Develop unit and integration tests for the authentication service.
        Document the user and authentication service API.

### Milestone 3: Product and Inventory Service

Objective: Develop services for managing products and inventory, including CRUD operations and stock management.

    Tasks:
        Design the product and inventory schemas (PostgreSQL).
        Implement the product service, with endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting products.
        Create the inventory service to manage stock levels, including logic for reserving and releasing stock.
        Integrate message queues (Kafka) to handle stock updates between product and inventory services.
        Add unit and integration tests for both product and inventory services.
        Document API endpoints for the product and inventory services.

### Milestone 4: Order Service and Checkout Flow

Objective: Implement an order service that processes orders, handles payments, and manages the checkout process.

    Tasks:
        Design the order schema, including order items, status, and payment details.
        Implement the checkout process, including adding items to the cart and proceeding to payment.
        Integrate a payment gateway (dummy or sandbox) to process payments.
        Implement an order status update flow using the message queue for inter-service communication.
        Implement unit tests and integration tests for the order service.
        Document the order service API and checkout process.

### Milestone 5: Notification and Logging Services

Objective: Create a notification service for customer communication and a logging service to monitor system events.

    Tasks:
        Implement a notification service that sends emails or SMS notifications for key events (e.g., order confirmation, stock alerts).
        Integrate third-party APIs for sending notifications (e.g., SendGrid, Twilio).
        Develop a logging service to capture logs across services and centralize them in a logging database (e.g., Elasticsearch).
        Configure log forwarding and setup basic monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
        Test the notification service and logging functionality.

### Milestone 6: Security, Testing, and Performance Optimization

Objective: Ensure security, performance, and reliability through additional testing, monitoring, and optimizations.

    Tasks:
        Perform load testing and optimize for performance, especially around API endpoints and database queries.
        Implement security measures (e.g., input validation, rate limiting, and secure data storage).
        Conduct penetration testing to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
        Add additional tests for edge cases, failure scenarios, and ensure consistent code quality.
        Improve documentation, including setup guides and architecture diagrams.

### Milestone 7: Deployment and Production-Ready Setup

Objective: Deploy the project on a cloud platform and ensure it is production-ready.

    Tasks:
        Configure a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean) with container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).
        Set up environment configurations for staging and production.
        Integrate CI/CD pipeline with cloud deployment.
        Set up monitoring dashboards (Grafana) and alerting for critical metrics.
        Conduct a final review of documentation and codebase.

### Milestone 8: Documentation, Demo, and Future Enhancements

Objective: Finalize documentation, prepare a demo, and identify areas for future improvements.

    Tasks:
        Compile detailed project documentation (setup, API docs, architecture).
        Create a demo application or presentation showcasing the e-commerce backendâ€™s functionality.
        Identify areas for future improvements (e.g., additional features, scaling strategies).
        Publish the project on GitHub with a clear README and contribution guidelines for open-source development.
